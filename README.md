# [FFF-poll](https://childishgiant.github.io/FFF-poll/)

Friday Facts #309 discusses several controversial opinions different members of the dev team have on certain game mechanics. I hastily made some polls
and people have, rightly so, pointed out that the phrasing of some of the questions is really confusing. I took the tiles of each section verbatim to make
sure that it was clear which proposal you're voting for but didn't realise that having things phrased negatively would muddy the waters. So I suggest you
take these results with a heaping of salt.
